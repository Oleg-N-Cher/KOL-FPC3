Key Object Library (KOL) port for Free Pascal 3.0.4

A set of library modules formed by Netspirit from HiAsm forum.
Here in the repository I plan to fix found errors.

If you are interested in the centralized development, not to be sprayed,
I propose to carry out development together. Write me at allot [] bk . ru

Reason to use KOL + FPC. KOL allows to have a small size of executables.
And although this size is smaller with Delphi than with FPC, it still makes sense,
since with Lazarus, Qt or GTK it is not less than a few megabytes at all.

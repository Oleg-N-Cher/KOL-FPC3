<h1 align="center"><small><font face="Arial"><strong>KOL - codo-economy object library for
Delphi</strong></font></small></h1>

<p align="right"><font face="Arial"><strong>Copyright (C) By Vladimir Kladov.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>The purpose of given article is to convince a
reader (I hopes, this text will fall into the hands of programmer), got accustomed to big
sizes of modern programs (on, no, applications, programs were not yet so large) that their
are unscrupulously cheaten. The cheat is following: when confirm that program for Windows
(for example), if it can do something useful, at all can not be less... well, will say,
about 300 kilobytes. But if this much &quot;clever&quot; program, containing much much
useful possibilities, good interface, fine interacting with the user, supports different
formats of data, modern client-server technology, it can not be less than 500 megs. The
unimaginable rubbish. We are defraud!</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Indeed, object programming allows to create
very economical on the size a code. Moreover, very efficient. Examples? Java. It is an
object-oriented programming. And Java applets much low on its sizes, but as much useful
they can do! However, speech will go not on the Java. Delphi is the subject of the
article.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Oddly to say, but Delphi is renderred as the
instrument, which made it possible to create a KOL library - Key Objects Library (Key
Object Library), which allows to produce very compact executables. This can seem strange
therefore, because programs, made using Delphi, usually are not so small. Minimum start
size of the executable, representing a single empty window, which can be moved on the
screen and closed, and can do nothing more, forms near 300 kilobytes of size. Moreover,
with every issue of each next Delphi generation such start size is increased on several
tenths of innocent kilobytes.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>The KOL library allows to make not less
powerful applications, than standard Delphi library - VCL (Visual Component Library). And
herewith obtain a reducing the sizes of programs in 5-15 times! For instance, executable
DirComp available for download on the KOL Web-Page, occupies without the compression near
65 kilobyteses. Similar executable written using a standard Delphi library, occupied 750
kilobyteses. Difference is impressing, not truth?</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>KOL is not only object-oriented, as well it is
visual library. Programs and their graphic interface can be designed actually in the same
way, as in VCL visual ambience. KOL is followed with MCK library (Mirror Classes Kit),
which contains of VCL-components, installing on the palette by the usual way. The single
difference in that mirror components of library MCK exist only on stage of development
(design time), participating in generations &quot;real&quot; code compatible with
requirements of library KOL. In operation (run time) this code is executed, and those,
which was added by developer himself. In the run-time code there are no references to VCL
components, only to KOL objects, compact and efficient.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>What is the secret of of code compactness?
Answer is not a single, but it is possible to select the main reasons. In first, let us
note Delphi compiler ability to exclude unclaimed code while linking the executable.
Procedures and variables, which are not referred from other code (which is already
contributed in the code area list), are rejected and in the further assembly are not
considered. Regrettably, this ability of Delphi compiler (named &quot;smart linking&quot;)
is limited a lot. In particular, virtual methods of used classes and objects can not be
withdraw from the process of compiling and assemblies of the executable. Accordingly,
variables and procedures (methods), which are referenced from such virtual methods, also
can be not rejected.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>While planning the KOL, this circumstances were
taken into account. The author abandoned hard following to object-oriented programming
canons. In particular, in KOL one and same object type can be used for encapsulations
several objects similar to each other. For instance, TControl type is not base for the
visual objects like in VCL. TControl object type in the KOL library without some
inheritance can execute a role of different visual objects (buttons, labels, edits, etc.)
- depending on what global function was used to create each object (for instance,
NewPanel, NewButton and etc.)</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Such method of combining of several objects in
one object type brings some mess, as far as alongside with methods and properties general
for all objects, there are exist methods and properties distinctive only for certain
object kinds. As far as type (class) is the same, there is exist a probability of wrong
using a methods, not proper for the given kind of the object. The important reason to go
this way, was a necessity to avoid a large number of virtual methods.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Of course, if virtual methods were successfully
skipped by the compiler in cases, when they not needed (and potentially such possibility
exists), structure of objects could be clearer. However, even and in this case VCL did not
allow programs to become much more compact. And problem here already in what way VCL
developers designed their library so that many objects are created and many actions are
produced even before those become really necessary, and either stay just stored in code
section without executing, or perform absolutely unnecessary work. For instance, if a
visual object is created, it initializy font, canvas for drawing, drag-and-dock managers,
ensemble of many other objects - on any event: but suddenly are necessary! Certainly,
program may need any of those capabilities, such as changing object's font. Program can be
designed for using a popular interface using drag-and-dock. It can, but after all not
obliged, yes?</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>In contrasted to VCL, KOL library works with
unnecessary actions and objects vastly more neatly. They (actions) are executed and
(objects) are initialized only when they are taked for the first time. Clearing of
resources and memory allocated in the destructor is not a problem: the single and the same
(virtual) method Free beautifully copes with the task. Strictly, this is the main reason
why program, made using KOL library, are so small in size.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>In the KOL library several different ways are
used to implement such postponed decision, depending on natures of code unnecessary to
include to the final code. It is more important not to enumerate these ways, which,
generally speaking, are simply ingenious using the generally accepted programmer's
acceptance, but it is much more important to explain and understand an essence of their
action.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>Well known that source text of a program is
compiled to executable code in result of functioning several programs: pre-compiler,
compiler, picker. Note that when we are telling about Delphi, there are no sense to
separate these steps, since all of these are executed by the same program. So, dialect
&quot;compiler&quot;, shall imply all these stages together. As far as Delphi compiler
comes to a conclusion, to include or not to include a code of a procedure or function to
the program, it should explain, how this process can be controlled from a library code
depending on whether it is requested by the developer of the project or not.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>All these can be explained with a following
simple example. Let our visual object (button, to the example) is kept Font property
(font). Unlike VCL, shall not create a correspondent object in the constructor of our
object (button, master of the font). Instead, create it first in a method, which executes
reading of the Font property (method GetFont), in case when it not yet created. If there
are no reading of the Font property in the executable at all (i.e. developer need not
change a font of their own visual objects, and all such ones use standard font), compiler
does not find any reference to GetFont method, and accordingly, does not include a code of
this method to the program. Since this, no references will be discovered nor on the
constructor of object of font, nor on other procedures, which otherwise are used and have
got in the executable module.</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>This example explains only one of the many used
ways. But the idea of all such ways is the same, as it was already said above: to postpone
a decision if to include an additional code until it does not requested by the project
developer. The opinion of the author is, that this way is totally branches off with modern
programming practice. The KOL gives an example, which in particular proved an absurdity of
the situation, when about 90% code in modern programs are slag, rubbish, which do not work
or idle, and only in vain consumes resources of a processor, operative memory, occupies a
place on hard disk, spend a time at the transmission of hudreds of superfluous kilobytes
on network and through internet, and spends your time and your many. And not for nothing
but sometimes in response to the question, &quot;how to reduce a size of a program&quot;,
we get following answer: &quot;Why to reduce? Than more volume, that will more pay&quot;.
(Variants: &quot;solid&quot;, customers more respect). Not nonsense?</strong></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong>If someone from Delphi-programmers read this
and interested in, welcome to the KOL/MCK Web-Page, download these libraries (all
absolutely free, with source codes), and try. Be sure: you will not regret!</strong></font></p>
